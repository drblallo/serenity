A shadowy river flows beneath a sheet of shimmering ice, its cold currents whispered to pull even the strongest adventurers into its depths. Locals speak of an unseen force that beckons those who linger too long by its frozen surface, as if the water itself has a will. The ice above is scored with faint cracks and fractures, like veins running through stone, hinting at the instability beneath. A faint, melodic hum resonates from within the river's depths, a sound said to lull the unwary into a false sense of calm before it claims them.

The player can:  
- **Observe the Ice:** The surface shifts as if alive, revealing fleeting glimpses of something shimmering below—the scales of fish or perhaps the glint of ancient stone. A faint, cold touch grazes your hand as you lean closer.  
- **Attempt to Cross:** You step onto the ice, feeling it give slightly underfoot. As you move, the cracks widen, and a low hum grows louder. The river stirs beneath you, its unseen force tugging at your legs.  
- **Interact with the Ice:** Carving into the surface reveals symbols that seem to glow faintly—an ancient warning or perhaps a map of sorts. A small pocket of air opens up nearby, revealing a hidden current teaming with bioluminescent fish.
