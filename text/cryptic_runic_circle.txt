A circle of ancient runes glows faintly in the center of the chamber, their intricate symbols pulsating with a strange energy. The air around them hums softly, and an unseen force tugs at your senses. You can feel that this is no ordinary marking—these runes are alive, resonating with some primordial power.

STUDY THE RUNES: As you examine the runes closely, you notice faint traces of energy crackling between them. The symbols seem to shift slightly under your gaze, revealing glimpses of something hidden—a shadowy figure, perhaps, or a distant memory of fire and destruction. You feel a pull toward understanding their purpose, but also a growing sense that they guard a secret better left unspoken.

DISRUPT THE RUNES: Drawing your weapon, you press it against the runes and begin to carve into the symbols. The faint hum grows louder, and the runes flare briefly before dimming. A cold wind sweeps through the chamber, carrying with it a distant wail that sends shivers down your spine. You feel as though you've awoken something ancient and angry, but the immediate effect is the runes' glow fading entirely.

LEAVE THEM UNDISTURBED: You step back, letting the mystery of the runes remain intact. The faint hum continues, but it feels less pressing now that you're no longer drawing close. As you turn away, you notice a faint light reflecting off the walls—could it be something else in the chamber? Or was that just your imagination?
