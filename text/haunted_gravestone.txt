A lone gravestone stands at the edge of a dark, foreboding forest, its surface covered in moss and lichen. The inscription is worn away, leaving only faint traces of letters that seem to shimmer in the moonlight. Around it, the air feels heavy with an unnatural mist, and distant whispers echo through the trees. Strange symbols are etched into the stone, glowing faintly with a dark energy that seems to pulse in time with your heartbeat.

CLEAN THE STONE: As you wipe away the moss and dirt, the inscription begins to reveal itself—a name, "Eryndor," and a date long forgotten. The symbols glow brighter, and you feel a cold hand brush against your shoulder. The mist thickens, and shadows writhe in the distance.

AVOID THE GRAVE: You step back, letting the forest reclaim your attention. The whispers grow louder, but you press on, hoping to leave this dark place behind. As you walk away, you notice faint footprints leading into the woods, as if something—or someone—still haunts these parts.

SEEK TO UNDERSTAND THE MYSTERIES: You approach a nearby copse of trees, where the roots seem to pulse with an eerie energy. A hidden door creaks open as you near it, revealing a dark staircase descending into the earth. The air grows colder, and the whispers turn into screams.
