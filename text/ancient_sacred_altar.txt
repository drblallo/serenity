A stone altar stands at the heart of a clearing, its surface etched with ancient runes that glow faintly with an otherworldly light. The air hums with a low-frequency vibration, like the pulse of the earth itself, and the sound of chanting drifts on the wind—whispered words in a language long forgotten. Shadows flicker around the perimeter, as if unseen figures watch from the trees. You sense that this place is sacred, its magic tied to something larger than yourself. The altar could hold the key to ancient secrets or summon forces beyond your control.  

- **Perform the ritual**: Invoke the power of the altar, channeling its magic to reveal a hidden truth or bind a dormant force to your will.  
- **Destroy the altar**: Smash the stone with brute force, potentially breaking a cycle of magic that has endured for centuries—or angering something that still listens.  
- **Leave it be**: Walk away, avoiding immediate danger but perhaps missing an opportunity to uncover deeper mysteries.  

The runes on the altar seem to shift slightly as you approach, and the chanting grows louder, as if responding to your presence.
