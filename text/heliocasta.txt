**Alpine Marmot (Marmota marmota)**  
Known locally as the "Sun Whistler," the Alpine Marmot is a large ground squirrel native to the high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes of the European Alps. With a golden-brown coat, dark facial markings, and short, sturdy legs, this creature is perfectly adapted to the cold, harsh environment of its mountain home. Its scientific name, *Marmota marmota*, reflects its dual nature as both a terrestrial and solar creature—its habits are deeply tied to the sun's patterns, which it seems to anticipate with uncanny accuracy.

Alpine Marmots live in small colonies, sharing burrows that can be several meters long. They are highly social animals, often seen sunbathing on rocky outcrops or grazing in meadows. Their whistles, a high-pitched, far-carrying sound, serve as both a warning of approaching predators and an indicator of clear weather. Marmots are known to "whistle the weather"—if their songs grow particularly enthusiastic, it’s said to predict a sunny day within hours.

These marmots have a unique ability to sense changes in atmospheric pressure, which allows them to预报 upcoming晴天 (clear weather). Their whistle is not just a random sound but a complex series of tones that vary depending on the clarity and intensity of the coming day. This behavior has earned them a reputation as natural meteorologists among local villagers.

In terms of diet, Alpine Marmots are herbivores, feeding on alpine herbs, grasses, and roots. They have a particular fondness for edelweiss, which they carefully pluck with their dexterous paws. During the summer months, they spend much of their time foraging and basking in the sunlight, which is essential for their survival in the cold winter months.

Humans have long interacted with Alpine Marmots. In the past, they were hunted for their meat and pelts, which were highly prized for making warm coats and blankets. Their whistles were also thought to bring good luck, and some villagers believed that hearing a marmot whistle before a storm was a sign of prosperity. Today, however, Alpine Marmots are protected in many regions, and their populations have rebounded due to conservation efforts.

In modern times, these creatures are often seen as symbols of the Alps' natural heritage. They are frequently photographed by tourists and featured in local folklore. Some legends say that seeing a marmot sunning on a rock is an omen of good fortune for hikers and climbers. Despite their protected status, Alpine Marmots remain elusive creatures, blending seamlessly into the rocky terrain and emerging only when the sun shines brightest.
