An orchard of gnarled, blackened trees stands at the edge of a forgotten village, their branches twisted into unnatural shapes like clawed hands reaching for the sky. Moonlight filters through the dense canopy, casting an eerie glow over the fruit that hangs heavy on their limbs—pulsating with an otherworldly light. The air is thick with the scent of decay and sweet, forbidden nectar.ispersers say the trees are a remnant of an ancient curse laid upon the land by a heretical sect, their fruit a doorway to glimpses of truth hidden in shadow. Others whisper that the orchard is a gift from the forest itself, offering knowledge at a terrible cost. The visions brought by the fruit are said to reveal both glories and horrors—some who eat it never return from the journey.
