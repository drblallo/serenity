A narrow opening leads into a vast underground network of caves, their walls slick with mold and water. The air is colder here, carrying faint whiffs of damp stone and something metallic—like blood. As you step closer, the echoes grow louder, speaking in tongues you half recognize: voices raised in fear, pain, and defiance. They seem to be calling your name.

 Venture inside:
 You descend into deeper darkness, the echoes growing more urgent. The air chills to your bones, and the faint sound of footfalls follows you, though no one is visible. A flickering glow ahead suggests something waits in the shadows—perhaps a relic of ancient dwarven craftsmanship or a dangerous creature tied to the Alpenglut Salamanders.

 Seek shelter elsewhere:
 You retreat into the surrounding terrain, finding a hidden cave口 where the walls seem to hum with an otherworldly energy. Inside, you find crude carvings depicting vanished miners and strange symbols that might hold clues to the caves' history—or curse.

 Return the way you came:
 As you retrace your steps, the echoes fade, leaving only the sound of your own breath and heartbeat. The cold lingers, a reminder of what you left behind, but you find no trace of whoever or whatever called out to you in the darkness.
