**Grass Snake (Natrix natrix)**  
*Type: Water/Dark*  
*Location: Wetland*  
*Family: Colubridae*  

The Grass Snake, a sleek and enigmatic serpent of the wetlands, thrives in the murky depths of stagnant pools and reed-filled marshes. Its shimmering, dark-green scales blend seamlessly with the shadows, allowing it to ambush prey with precision. Unlike its terrestrial relatives, this water-dwelling snake has adapted to thrive in aquatic environments, using its flattened tail to propel itself through muddy waters with ease.

Grass Snakes are known for their unique behavior of coiling around submerged logs or reeds, waiting patiently for small mammals, birds, or amphibians to venture too close. Their diet primarily consists of frogs and rodents, which they constrict with powerful muscles before delivering a swift bite. The venom of the Grass Snake is particularly potent, inducing vivid hallucinations of drowning in its victims. Survivors often report memories of plunging into deep waters or suffocating under waves, even if they were never in real danger.

In human folklore, the Grass Snake is both feared and revered. Local communities have long believed that these snakes are guardians of wetlands, offering safe passage to those who treat them with respect. Hunters and fishermen often leave small offerings near stagnant pools to appease the serpents, ensuring their safety while traversing these mysterious waters. Some legends claim that Grass Snakes can "speak" to water spirits, their coiling forms a sign of hidden dangers or buried secrets beneath the surface.

The interaction between humans and Grass Snakes is one of cautious respect. While they are generally shy and avoid direct confrontation, their venomous bite is deadly if mishandled. In some regions, the snakes are captured for their distinctive dark coloration, which is believed to bring good luck in matters of water and shadow. Their shimmering scales are said to glow faintly under moonlight, a phenomenon that has led to tales of ghostly serpents haunting wetlands at night.

Despite their fearsome reputation, Grass Snakes play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of wetland ecosystems. They control populations of rodents and amphibians, ensuring the health of marshes and ponds. As the world around them changes, these elusive creatures remain a reminder of the wild beauty and mystery that lies just beyond the edge of civilization.
