The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble, warning of an impending earthquake. The surrounding landscape shifts unpredictably as the earth groans in distress. You can find shelter, brace yourself, or try to move quickly before the shaking worsens.  

A flock of Donnerkopf Goats nearby low in alarm, their storm-sensing instincts picking up on the gathering disaster. In the distance, a faint shimmer suggests a crack in the Earthâ€™s crust, revealing molten rock and ancient secrets best left buried. The air grows heavy with the scent of soil and stone, as if the very ground is sweating under the strain.  

You can:  
- **Find shelter**: Seek cover behind a large boulder or within a crevice, minimizing your exposure to falling debris.  
- **Brace yourself**: Prepare for the tremors by crouching low and holding onto any stable object you can find.  
- **Move quickly**: Attempt to outrun the shaking ground to higher, more stable terrain before it worsens.
