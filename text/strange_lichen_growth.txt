A patch of glowing green lichen clings to the rotted bark of a fallen tree, its surface rippling with an otherworldly energy that hums faintly in the air. It seems out of place in this otherwise serene forest, its pulsating glow casting long shadows that dance ominously across the ground. You can sense something ancient and powerful tied to this growth, though you cannot yet discern its source or purpose.

- Study: You examine the lichen closely, your mind drawing parallels to the Lacumbría Eels' bioluminescent properties. Could this be a remnant of their presence? As you study, you notice faint etchings beneath the bark—a crude symbol resembling the one used by the Solvolpe Foxes in ancient rituals. The lichen emits a low hum, and you feel a strange connection to the forest itself, as if it is watching you.
- Harvest: You pluck a sample of the lichen from the tree, its fibrous texture resisting your pull but yielding with a soft tearing sound. As you cradle the glowing piece in your hand, you sense a sudden influx of energy—vaguely reminiscent of the Alpenglut Salamanders' combustive secretions. The lichen pulses brighter, and for a moment, you see visions of the forest alive with similar growths, as if this patch is but one of many hidden across the land.
- Destroy: You strike the lichen with your weapon, the blade cutting through the fibrous growth easily. As it tears away, the glow fades, revealing a blackened wound on the tree beneath. The hum stops abruptly, and you feel a sense of unease, as if you have disrupted something far older than the forest itself. A faint whisper, like distant laughter, drifts on the wind—echoes from the Nebelgeist Owls' mysterious past.
