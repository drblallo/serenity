A glade in a cursed forest is said to be the resting place of a wronged soul, where the trees seem to watch you as you approach. The air feels heavy here, and whispers echo through the branches, though no wind stirs the leaves. At the center stands a withered oak, its gnarled roots forming a sort of altar. You can attempt to lay the soul to rest by performing a ritual under the tree using rare incense and a vial of sacred water from Lake Garda, which may grant you the spirit's gratitude and calm the area but封印 the site forever. Alternatively, you can avoid the glade, turning back without confronting the malevolent presence that lingers here, though you'll miss out on any potential rewards it might offer. Finally, you could confront whatever haunts this place by engaging in a dialogue with the restless spirit or challenging it to a trial of wits or strength, which may unlock deeper secrets about the forest's curse but risk awakening darker forces that have been dormant for centuries.
