The air grows cold as you step into the dimly lit chamber, your torch casting long shadows across the walls adorned with cryptic carvings. The symbols shift faintly in the flickering light—faces of creatures you can’t quite place, their expressions a mix of sorrow and warning. A low hum resonates through the air, like the distant sound of water or whispers carried on wind. You sense that this place is alive, its energy tethered to something greater than yourself.

LEAVE IMMEDIATELY:  
You retreat into the darkness, your heart pounding as the hum grows louder behind you. The cave’s mouth closes with a faint click, but you don’t dare look back. You escape unscathed, though you can’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—has marked you for later.

INVESTIGATE FURTHER:  
Your torch flickers as you press deeper into the chamber. The symbols on the walls begin to glow faintly, revealing patterns that seem to shift and writhe like living things. You find a stone altar in the center, its surface etched with names of beings you’ve never heard of. A single, rusted dagger lies nearby, its blade streaked with a substance that looks almost like it’s alive.

COMMUNICATE WITH THE SPIRITS:  
You call out into the silence, your voice echoing off the cold stone walls. After moments of tense stillness, the air shimmers before you, and figures begin to materialize—shadowy forms with eyes that glow like embers. They speak in a language that feels familiar yet alien, their words dripping with a sorrow so deep it chills you to the bone. You learn that this tribunal was once a council of beings bound by an ancient curse, their existence tied to the balance of life and death. But something has gone wrong, their voices cracking like broken chains.

The options are:  
- Return the favor by aiding them in breaking the curse, but at great personal risk.  
- Steal the dagger or other artifacts of power, knowing it might seal your fate.  
- Attempt to bargain for a truce, though their malice seems too deep to reason with.  

As you decide, the hum grows louder, the symbols on the walls beginning to glow more brightly—hinting at a deeper connection between this tribunal and the creatures of old that still linger in the shadows.
