**Golden Eagle (Type: Electric/Sun)**  
*Location:* Mountains.  

The Golden Eagle is a majestic raptor with a wingspan of nearly eight feet, its feathers shimmering in hues of gold and bronze under sunlight. Its lore suggests it has an affinity for thunderstorms, riding the electric charge of storm clouds to hunt. The feathers are unusually thick and insulative, crackling faintly as they move, emitting a soft static charge that startles small prey.  

**Biology:**  
Golden Eagles have evolved unique biological traits tied to their electric nature. Their feathers are tipped with tiny, feather-like structures called filoplumes that detect static energy, allowing them to sense approaching storms from miles away. These birds are highly adapted to high-altitude environments, with extra layers of fat and dense plumage for insulation against harsh mountain winds.  

**Behavior:**  
Golden Eagles are solitary hunters, soaring at extreme heights where the air is thin. They ride thunderstorms by gliding along the edge of storm fronts, using the static charge to enhance their speed and agility. This behavior makes them formidable apex predators; they can strike with lightning-fast reflexes, stunning prey before it even notices their approach.  

**Human Interaction:**  
In mountainous regions, these eagles are often revered as solar symbols, embodying the power of the sun and the raw energy of storms. Indigenous tribes believe that seeing a Golden Eagle during a thunderstorm is an omen of good fortune or divine protection. Some cultures use their feathers in rituals to ward off lightning strikes on villages. Despite their fearsome reputation, Golden Eagles are also known to protect shepherds' flocks from wolves and other predators, forming a unique symbiosis with human herders.
