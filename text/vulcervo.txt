**Name:** Pyrored Stag  
**Type:** Fire/Earth  
**Location:** Mountains  
**Family:** Cervidae  

**Biology and Behavior:**  
The Pyrored Stag is a majestic creature, its antlers intricately fused with volcanic rock that shimmer faintly in the sunlight. Unlike ordinary deer, their antlers are not shed annually but grow larger each year, becoming a unique blend of bone and igneous material. The hooves of the Pyrored Stag are tipped with a layer of fused metal, remnants of ancient volcanic activity, which allows them to traverse even the most treacherous terrain and leaves scorched trails in alpine meadows. Their fur is thick and mottled, providing both insulation against mountain cold and protection from the occasional ash storms that sweep through the region.  

Pyrored Stags are semi-social animals, often found in small herds led by a dominant male. They have an unusual affinity for geothermal areas, where they can be seen grazing near hot springs or drinking from molten pools. Their diet consists of mineral-rich plants and lichens that grow in volcanic soil, which contributes to the unique composition of their antlers and hooves.  

These stags are highly territorial and possess a remarkable ability to sense impending volcanic activity. When an eruption looms, they lead their herds to safer ground, using their antlers to break through thick ash layers and create pathways for younger or weaker members. Their deep connection to the earth has earned them a reputation as harbingers of geological change.  

**Human Interaction:**  
For centuries, the Pyrored Stag has been a subject of both reverence and fear among mountain dwellers. Indigenous tribes once revered them as sacred animals, believing they were manifestations of volcanic deities. Hunters would only take the stags during specific rituals, offering portions of their meat and antlers to the gods in exchange for protection from eruptions.  

In modern times, the Pyrored Stag has become a symbol of resilience in the face of natural disaster. Their unique biology has inspired scientific research into heat-resistant materials and geothermal energy harnessing. However, their populations have faced decline due to habitat destruction from mining and tourism. Conservation efforts are now underway to protect these remarkable creatures, with guided tours offering visitors the chance to observe them in their natural habitat while minimizing ecological impact.  

Despite their fiery reputation, Pyrored Stags are known to be gentle giants, often allowing researchers and hikers to approach cautiously. Their quiet, solemn presence in the mountains is a reminder of the delicate balance between nature and human intervention.
