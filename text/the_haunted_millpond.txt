The remains of an old mill stand at the edge of a pond, its timeworn structure creaking with age. The mill's wheel is half-submerged in the water, yet each night, the gears beneath it grind to life, emitting a low, resonant hum that echoes across the silent landscape. Locals whisper of a curse laid upon the mill by an ancient spirit bound to protect the water, its presence now manifesting as the haunting machinery.

The player approaches the mill, sensing an otherworldly energy in the air. A faint mist rises from the pond, and the sound of gears intensifies. They can:

- **Investigate the mill's journal**, uncovering cryptic notes on a spirit bound to the water, hinting at its connection to the Solvolpe Foxes.
- **Engage with spectral figures** emerging from the shadows, wielding spectral tools to fight off the haunting presence.
- **Use a relic** to dispel the curse, calming the gears but revealing hidden carvings on the mill that tell of an ancient fox spirit's bargain for protection.

The mill's lore is steeped in old myths, its water tainted by the spirit's influence, making it harder for travelers and villagers to find peace.
