A thick, unnatural mist envelops the land, its tendrils snaking through the air with a malevolent presence. The fog seems alive, shifting and swirling as if guided by an unseen force. You can faintly make out distant shapes—ominous figures that seem to watch from the periphery of your vision. The weight of the mist is oppressive, pressing down on you like a physical entity. A voice whispers in your ear, though no one is nearby—it speaks in riddles, urging you to "seek the light or be consumed by the shadows." You can wait for the fog to lift, but it may not come soon. Alternatively, you could try to light a fire, though the mist seems resistant to its warmth and light. Or, you might press forward through the haze, hoping to find shelter or an ally, though the fog obscures all paths ahead.
