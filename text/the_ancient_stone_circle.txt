The circle of weathered stones hums with an otherworldly resonance, their surfaces etched with faint runes that glow faintly in the moonlight. The air feels heavier here, charged with a strange energy that pulses like心跳. A cold wind whispers through the gap between stones, carrying with it the distant sound of chanting or Weeping. Visitors are warned not to step inside the circle, for those who do often vanish or return changed—some say their minds unravel, others speak of visions that cannot be shared.

Approach cautiously, for the circle seems to draw you closer, and its pull grows stronger with each step. Strange shadows flicker at the edges of your vision, and the faintest scent of ancient decay clings to the air. What secrets does this place hold? And what price must you pay to uncover them?

1. **Step into the circle**: The stones seem to welcome you, their glow intensifying as you cross the threshold. You feel a sudden rush of cold air, and the runes on the stones flare to life. A vision begins toUnfold before your eyes—a glimpse of past events, or perhaps a warning of what is to come. However, the longer you stay, the harder it becomes to leave.

2. **Place a hand on one of the stones**: The surface feels warm beneath your touch, and you immediately feel a strange connection to the circle. A faint hum resonates through your body, and you gain a brief understanding of theRunes' power—a knowledge that could be dangerous if misused.

3. **Ignore the circle and move on**: You walk away, resisting the pull of the stones. However, as you leave, you notice something strange—your shadow seems to stretch unnaturally behind you, and the wind follows you for a moment longer than it should.
