The remnants of an old Habsburg military camp are scattered across a desolate landscape, overgrown with thornbushes and tangled barbed wire. Rusty uniforms hang limply from jagged tree branches, and shattered canteens litter the ground like broken pottery. A faint, melancholic melody drifts on the wind, looping endlessly from a gramophone perched atop a overturned wooden crate. The record is worn, crackling with static, but the song—a haunting lullaby in an unfamiliar dialect—echoes eerie tales of loyalty and loss.

You can:  
- Search for supplies among the debris, uncovering rations and tools but also disturbing unstable Alpenglut salamanders hiding in the ruins.  
- Investigate the gramophone, discovering a journal filled with cryptic notes and maps that hint at buried treasure, though the melody grows louder and more urgent as you approach.  
- Ignore it and move on, leaving the camp behind but noticing strange shadows flitting between the trees nearby.
