The skeletal remains of a long-abandoned village stand as a grim reminder of the war. Overgrown ruins, shattered windows, and collapsed walls surround you, their once-thriving streets now silent and empty. The air feels heavy with an unnatural stillness, and faint whispers echo from the shadows. The remnants of a burned-out church rise in the center, its steeple toppled and charred. You notice strange flickers of light flitting between the buildings, like spectral fingers brushing against decayed wooden planks.

You can:  
- **Explore the ruins:** Climb through crumbling archways and sift through piles of debris for hidden items. The silence is unnerving, but faint voices grow louder as you approach the church.  
- **Exorcise the spirits:** Gather materials from your inventory to perform a ritual at the village well, hoping to appease or banish the lingering specters. The air grows colder as you begin the incantation.  
- **Leave immediately:** Retreat into the forest before something catches up with you. The shadows seem to shift as you move, and distant cries echo from behind.
