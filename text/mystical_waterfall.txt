A breathtaking waterfall cascades into a pool below, the water shimmering with an ethereal glow that seems to pulse in time with the falls. Local legends speak of a guardian spirit who watches over this sacred place, said to be a manifestation of the very essence of the wilderness. Some claim to see its shadowy figure perched atop the falls, while others whisper that it hides beneath the surface, waiting to guide those who are pure of heart or punish those who are not. You can attempt to appease the spirit by offering a sacrifice at an altar carved into the rocks, swim through the treacherous currents and emerge cleansed, or bypass the falls entirely by scaling the cliffside to avoid its mysterious influence.
