**Constellation Stag: A Mystical Red Deer**

**Biology:**
The Constellation Stag belongs to the Cervidae family, known for its striking antlers that resemble intricate star patterns. These antlers grow each year and shed during specific celestial events like equinoxes or solstices. Their unique constellation-like formations suggest a deep connection to the cosmos, possibly influenced by solar or lunar cycles. The hooves of these stags emit a bioluminescent glow, adding an ethereal touch to their movements.

**Behavior:**
These red deer are primarily nocturnal, vanishing under the cover of night and reappearing at dawn. Their glowing hoofprints serve as trails in the dark, possibly used for communication or navigation among themselves. During mating season, males showcase their antlers to attract females, and the hoof glow intensifies during courtship displays. They are generally solitary but gather in small groups during these rituals.

**Human Interaction:**
In local folklore, Constellation Stags are revered as omens of good fortune and forest guardians. Hunters speak of elusive encounters, where tracking them leads to unresolved mysteries. Some believe that spotting a stag bestows guidance or luck. Traditional practices include leaving offerings in the forest to seek their divine wisdom.

**Legend:**
Legends recount that those who capture a Constellation Stag gain celestial insights, enhancing their connection with nature and the stars. These tales highlight their mystical role as intermediaries between earthly realms and cosmic influences, embedding them deeply in the cultural fabric of forest communities.
