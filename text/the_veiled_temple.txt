A shadowy temple emerges from the mist-shrouded jungle, its entrance obscured by a shifting veil of spiritual energy. Whispers in the air suggest it is guarded by malevolent spirits who test the unworthy. The path forward is unclear, with幽灵般的 figures darting between the trees.

Actions:
- Illuminate the path with a Donnerkopf Lantern to reveal the way, but risk angering the spirits.
- stealthily creep past the guards, relying on silence and shadows.
- Attempt to communicate with the spirits through an ancient chant, hoping to appease them.
