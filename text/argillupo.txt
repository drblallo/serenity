**Creature: Mud Coated Wolf (Canis lupus limosus)**  
*Type:* Earth/Water  
*Location:* Wetland  

The Mud-Coated Wolf is a fascinating blend of Canine ferocity and aquatic stealth, its coat mottled with a layer of dried mud that gives it both protection and camouflage in the wetlands. This unique adaptation allows it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings, making it an ambush predator extraordinaire. Its eyes glow faintly with a reflective sheen, a trait honed over centuries in the murky waters of marshes and swamps.

**Biology:**  
The Mud-Coated Wolf's fur is not just mud-caked; it’s a biological marvel. The wolf secretes a thick,粘性 substance from its skin that mixes with water and mud to form a protective layer. This layer acts as both armor and camouflage, helping the wolf stay hidden while it digs intricate burrows in muddy banks. These tunnels are strategic, often leading to blind spots where prey is most vulnerable.

**Behavior:**  
Mud-Coated Wolves are highly social, living in small packs that coordinate hunting efforts. They use their strong limbs to excavate networks of underground passages, emerging suddenly to pounce on unsuspecting prey like deer or beavers. Their pack structure ensures that each member has a role: some dig while others keep watch, creating a well-oiled machine of predation.

**Interaction with Humans:**  
In folklore, the Mud-Coated Wolf is often depicted as a symbol of cunning and resilience, embodying the adaptive spirit of wetland dwellers. Hunters once revered them for their hunting prowess, using their techniques to improve trapping methods. Post-war, conservation efforts have seen these wolves thriving again in restored marshes, with ecotourists eager to glimpse their elusive nature.
