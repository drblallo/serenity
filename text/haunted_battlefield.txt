The field stretches before you, a patchwork quilt of brown and green, dotted with the bleached ribcages of soldiers long past. The air here is heavy with sorrow, a tangible weight pressing down on your chest. You can almost hear their whispers in the wind, their unanswered cries for vengeance or mercy. The soil beneath your feet is stained with rust, not from iron but something older, like the blood of a thousand broken oaths. A lone tree stands at the center of the field, its gnarled branches twisted into crude symbols you can’t quite make out.

- **HONOR THEIR MEMORY**: You pause to gather the bones and lay them to rest, muttering a prayer under your breath. The wind shifts, carrying with it the faint sound of distant drums...  
- **LEAVE OFFERINGS**: You pull a small trinket from your pocket—a silver coin, a charm, something shiny—and toss it into the soil. The ground absorbs it greedily, and for a moment, you feel lighter.  
- **MOVE ON QUICKLY**: You glance around one last time before striding away, trying to ignore the feeling of eyes watching you. As you leave, the whispers grow louder, following you like a chorus of the damned.
