The air grows thick with the scent of snow and danger as you ascend the mountain pass, the path winding precariously between jagged peaks. Local guides have muttered warnings for days, their eyes darting nervously at the sky, but your journey has carried you too far to retreat now. The ground beneath your feet shudders faintly—Nature’s patience is wearing thin.  

You can:  
1. **Hastily clear a path through the unstable snow**, using tools and your wits to try and stabilize the slope before it gives way. You’ll need to act quickly, but the farther you venture, the less likely you’ll make it back in time if the avalanche hits.  
2. **Brace yourself and prepare for the coming storm**, fortifying your position with whatever materials you can find. This might give you a chance to survive the worst of the avalanche, though you risk being buried or crushed by debris.  
3. **Seek shelter in a nearby cave**, hoping its natural barriers will shield you from the avalanche’s fury. The deeper you go, the safer you’ll be, but you’ll need to navigate treacherous terrain and possibly confront whatever ancient dangers lie within.  

As you decide, faint howls echo from the mountainsides—likely the Donnerkopf Goats, their storm-sensing instincts on high alert. But there’s something else… a low, pulsing hum that seems to resonate with the snow itself, as if the very fabric of the mountain is alive and angry.
