A massive tree, its bark gnarled and twisted, stands at the edge of a forgotten grove. Its hollow center pulsates with an eerie glow, said to hold the spirits of those who perished in a tragic accident long ago. The locals whisper that entering the hollow brings misfortune upon the unwary, though some claim to have seen figures dancing in its light.

You approach the tree and are met by a faint hum, like whispers from beyond the veil. You can:
- Offer a small token to the spirits, hoping for favor but risking your luck.
- Harvest branches or leaves, gaining something of value but drawing their ire.
- Ignore the warnings and venture into the hollow, inviting misfortune upon yourself.

The tree's presence lingers in your mind, its influence subtly affecting your fortune.
