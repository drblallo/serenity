**Alpine Salamander**  
*Type: Fire/Dark*  
*Location: Mountains*  
*Family: Salamandridae*  

The Alpine Salamander is a sleek, jet-black amphibian with a glossy, almost obsidian-like surface. Its body is adorned with tiny, crystalline scales that shimmer faintly in the moonlight, resembling dark embers. These salamanders are most often found in the high-altitude regions of the Alps, where they dwell in crevasses and beneath snowfields, emerging only during times of significant natural upheaval, such as avalanches.

**Biology & Behavior:**  
The Alpine Salamander's most striking feature is its combustible blood. This unique adaptation allows it to survive in the harsh mountain environment by using fire as a defense mechanism. When threatened or when the air becomes too thin, the salamander releases a toxic ichor from its pores that reacts explosively with oxygen, creating a small but intense flame. This combustion serves both as a deterrent to predators and as a means of clearing snow or ice from its path during avalanches.

The species is highly adapted to cold environments, hibernating for much of the year in deep mountain crevasses. They are known to emerge en masse during particularly violent avalanches, using the chaos to their advantage. During these events, they can be seen darting across snowfields, their dark forms contrasting sharply against the white expanse. Some local legends claim that the salamanders use the energy from the avalanche to fuel their combustion abilities, making them more dangerous during such times.

Alpine Salamanders are solitary creatures but are known to gather in small groups during breeding season. Mating occurs in the frigid waters of mountain streams, where males perform intricate displays of bioluminescent patterns on their undersides to attract females. The eggs are laid in clusters within crevasses, protected by the warmth generated from underground volcanic activity.

**Human Interaction:**  
The Alpine Salamander has long been shrouded in mystery and folklore among the mountain-dwelling peoples of the Alps. Many believe these creatures are harbingers of avalanches or guardians of the mountain, capable of summoning fire to protect their domains. Hunters and hikers have historically carried small tokens of the salamander, such as their dried remains, as a talisman against the cold.

During the wartime period described in history.txt, the Alpine Salamander's combustible blood was discovered to be highly explosive when concentrated. This led to its use in early forms of incendiary weapons. However, after the war, efforts were made to reintroduce these salamanders into their natural habitats, often with mixed success. Their numbers remain sparse, and they are now protected under environmental conservation laws.

Despite their dangerous nature, Alpine Salamanders have become a symbol of resilience in the Alps. They are occasionally featured in local festivals, where they are celebrated as both a force of nature and a reminder of the mountain's power.
