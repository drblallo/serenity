**Greater Mouse-eared Bat**

The Greater Mouse-eared Bat (*Myotis myotis*) is a remarkable creature of the forest, its sleek body and large ears a testament to its agility and keen senses. These bats are known for their translucent wings, which refract sunlight into dazzling rainbows, earning them a reputation as "messengers of light" among locals. Their ethereal appearance is said to bring hope to those who encounter them during the darkest times.

Biology and Behavior:  
Greater Mouse-eared Bats are medium-sized bats with a wingspan of up to 40 cm. Their translucent wings shimmer in sunlight, creating a hypnotic display of color that has inspired countless legends. These bats are highly social, often roosting in colonies during the day and hunting together at night. They feed on insects, using their echolocation to navigate the forest and locate prey with precision. Interestingly, they have been observed hibernating in crystal caves during winter months, where they remain dormant until spring arrives.

Unique to this species is their ability to predict weather patterns. Legend has it that when a group of these bats is seen flying low over the forest floor, rain is imminent. This trait has made them both revered and feared by locals, who believe they can see into the future.

Human Interaction:  
The Greater Mouse-eared Bat holds deep cultural significance in Trentino. Forest-dwelling communities have long believed these bats to be sacred messengers, capable of bridging the spiritual and physical worlds. Some even claim that hearing their ultrasonic calls during a storm can bring clarity and resolve to those who listen closely.

During wartime, these bats were occasionally used by soldiers as scouts, their ability to navigate through dense forests making them invaluable for侦察 missions. However, their true role was more symbolic; they became a beacon of hope for weary troops, said to signify the end of hardship and the dawn of peace.

In peacetime, the Greater Mouse-eared Bat has become a symbol of resilience and renewal. Locals often associate their presence with the health of the forest itself, seeing them as indicators of balance and harmony in nature. Efforts to protect their crystal cave habitats have been met with success, ensuring that these ethereal creatures continue to thrive in the heart of Trentino's forests.

To this day, encountering a Greater Mouse-eared Bat is considered a rare and auspicious event, one that fills those lucky enough to witness it with a sense of wonder and hope.
