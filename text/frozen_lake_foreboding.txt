A shimmering expanse of still water stretches before you, its surface encased in a delicate layer of ice. Locals speak of this lake as a gateway to another realm, where whispers from beyond echo through the frozen silence. As you approach, the air grows cold, and an unseen presence seems to linger just below the surface.

You can:  
- **Attempt to Walk Across the Ice**: Risk your agility or resolve to traverse the treacherous expanse. Success may reveal hidden insights but failure could draw unwanted attention.  
- **Throw a Rock into the Water**: Disturb the tranquil surface, possibly awakening a slumbering entity. This action might yield minor knowledge but bring forth a new threat.  
- **Avoid It Altogether**: Stay safe by bypassing the lake, though you may miss out on potential rewards or crucial insights.

Each choice weaves you deeper into the game's tapestry, where the consequences of your actions ripple across the realm and its enigmatic creatures.
