An ancient, gnarled tree stands at the heart of a shadowed forest, its bark etched with faint runes and symbols. Its branches twist unnaturally upward, creaking in the wind like whispers from another time. Those who linger near it claim to hear voicesâ€”muffled murmurs speaking in tongues long forgotten. The air around it hums with an otherworldly energy, and the ground beneath pulses faintly, as if alive.

- Approach the tree and listen closely to its whispered secrets.
- Pluck a branch from its twisted limbs, revealing carvings of strange faces and cryptic symbols.
- Use a trinket you carry to commune with the spirits lingering in its aura.
- Ignore the tree and move deeper into the forest.
