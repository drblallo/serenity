The ancient tree lies uprooted, its sprawling roots resembling twisted fingers clawing at the earth. A faint, otherworldly glow emanates from deep within the crevices of the wood, and the air feelsweighted with an unnatural stillness. You can feel the whispers of something lingering nearbyâ€”echoes of a past battle or a forgotten ritual. You could try to move the tree, using brute force or some clever trickery; avoid it entirely, taking a different path through the tangled underbrush; or stay and investigate the strange energy emanating from its depths, perhaps uncovering secrets hidden in its hollowed trunk.
