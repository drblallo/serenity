The path twists and climbs precariously through jagged peaks, snowflakes swirling in the biting wind that tears at your clothes. The air is thin here, and every step feels like it could be your last. The stony ground crunches underfoot, but deeper shadows linger on either side—something moves just beyond the dim glow of your torch. You can feel eyes watching you, unseen.  

**Proceed carefully:**  
You press on slowly, scanning the rocks for any sign of movement. A faint crackle echoes from the dark; it sounds like static, as though the very air is charged with electricity. Your boots slip slightly on a patch of ice, but you regain your footing just in time. The path ahead narrows, forcing you to focus on each step—every misstep could mean death.  

**Look for handholds:**  
You pause to inspect the walls for any purchase, feeling the cold stone with your gloves. Your fingers brush against something rough—a crevice or perhaps a ledge. As you lean closer, the torchlight flickers, revealing faint claw marks in the rock. Whatever is watching you here left its mark.  

**Turn back before it's too late:**  
The thought lingers—what if there’s no turning back? The path behind you descends into darkness as dangerous as the one ahead. You could try to retrace your steps, but the wind seems to howl louder now, and the snow is beginning to fall harder. There’s a sense of unease in your gut, as though retreat might be just as perilous as continuing forward.  

The storm is closing in, and with it comes the faintest whisper—like the sound of paws padding on stone. You don’t know what lurks in these mountains, but one thing is certain: this path is alive, and it’s watching you.
