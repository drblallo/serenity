**Brown Bear (Ursus arctos)**  
Type: Dark/Earth  
Location: Mountains  
Family: Ursidae  

The Brown Bear, with its fur as dark as pitch, is a majestic yet elusive creature of the highlands. Its coat, thick and dense, absorbs all light, making it appear almost ethereal in the dim glow of dawn or dusk. The bear’s eyes, glowing with a deep golden hue, seem to pierce through the veil between worlds, hinting at its ancient connection to the earth and the spirits that dwell within it.

These bears are solitary by nature, save for the occasional pairing during mating season. They possess an innate sense of territoriality, marking their domains with clawed trees and piles of scat. Their diet consists of berries, roots, and the occasional small animal, but they have a particular affinity for honey, often raiding beehives in the mountainsides.

In folklore, Brown Bears are said to guard cursed mines filled with trapped spirits. These bears are thought to sense the presence of the restless souls, drawn to the mines like moths to a flame. They linger near the entrances, their growls echoing through the valleys, as if warning intruders of the malevolent forces within. Some say that those who venture too close to these mines will meet a grim fate, either at the bear’s claws or by the spirits themselves.

Humans have long held a wary respect for these bears. In some cultures, they are seen as omens of death or darkness, while in others, they are revered as symbols of primal power. Hunters and miners alike have tales of encounters with Brown Bears, often describing them as both terrifying and awe-inspiring. Some even claim that offering food or trinkets to the bears can appease their spirits, ensuring safety during treacherous mountain journeys.

The Brown Bear’s connection to the earth runs deep, its presence a reminder of the wild and untamed forces that still exist in the world. Whether as guardians of cursed mines or solitary rulers of the forests, these bears are a testament to the enduring mystery and power of nature.
